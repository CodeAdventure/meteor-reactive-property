### [ReactiveProperty](ReactiveProperty.html)

A ReactiveProperty is a simple wrapper around the Meteor dependency system
and allows to easily set and get values that trigger reactivity. This can
be useful in any situation where you want some state to automagically change
when the value of this property changes.
